## ParseXML

The script allows to get the number of matches of a particular word from a random .xml file.

All of the .xml files are from age-specific chat rooms. 
Each file is a recording from one of these chat rooms for a short period on a particular day. 
The filename contains all this information plus the number of posts contained in the file. 
For example, the file 10-19-20s_706posts.xml contains 706 posts gathered from the 20s chat room on 10/19/2006.
